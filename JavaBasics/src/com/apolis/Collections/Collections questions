Can we override static method in Java?
	
	We can declare static methods with the same signature in the subclass, 
	but it is not considered overriding as there won’t be any run-time polymorphism. 
	Hence the answer is ‘No’. 
	If a derived class defines a static method with the same signature as a static 
	method in the base class, the method in the derived class is hidden by the method in the base class.
