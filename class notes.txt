Is the Bytecode verifier like a built in virus scanner?
What is the difference between JRE and JVM?
*Class loaders*
only JRE1.8

Static members can access anywhere in a class without using class name refence
    used to store common sata to all objects.
Instanced methods can only access within instances variables

local variable are stored in stack memory.

//Next time , make different examples for different concepts
static and instance data members
static and instance methods
data shadowing
single inheritance
multilevel inheritance
method overloading compile time polymorphism  //**get clarification on this
method overriding runtime polymorphism

lamda expressions and funtional interface
dynamic binding:  Parent parent = new Child();
method hiding: child and parent methods are both static with the same signature
5diferent ways to override methods: see above, different access modifiers, different return types (IS-A Relationship), 
super keyword cannot be called in static method.

Association, find out the difference between Aggregation and Composition data hiding
	Aggregation: Has-A relationship; Unidirectional (One-way) relationship; both Objects can survive individually; Weak Association
	Composition: Part-Of relationship, dependent on each other, both object cannot exist independently. Strong Association
A Text Editor owns a Buffer (composition). A Text Editor uses a File (aggregation). When the Text Editor is closed, the Buffer is destroyed but the File itself is not destroyed.
class Contained {
    public void disp() {
        System.out.println("disp() of Contained A");
    }
}

public class Container {
    private Contained c;

    //Composition
    Container() {
        c = new Contained(); 
    }

    //Association 
    public Contained getC() {
        return c;
    }

    public void setC(Contained c) {
        this.c = c;
    }     

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Container container = new Container();

---------------------------Day 3-----------------------------

1. anonymous (inner)child class     Parent parent = new Parent() { //new implementation of parent with inheritance// };
2. example of Type promotion         literals are ints, cannot implicity cast to byte or short
3. Interfaces                     example idea: Sortable? 
4. multiple inheritance in case of interface
5. One class can extend a class and implements another interface at same time
6. Abstract class     use shape classes with abstract area method

7. Upcasting, Downcasting, (Boxing & Unboxing)
8. Implement equals method
9. Cloning
10. Shallow cloning
11. Deep Cloning

Boxing: putting a variable into an Object (wrapper class)
Unboxing:   int x = new Integer(30);
Upcasting : casting a child as a parent        Parent x = new Child();
downcasting:                                         Child y = (Child)x;  //This only works if it was originally the same type
If you want to check what kind of object an object is, use instanceof keyword    (object instanceof Class)
Marker interface: empty interface. Indicates whether a class includes a certain functionality
equals method 
You have to implement Clonable to use the clone() method. return super.clone(); you may need to throw or catch an exception. Cloneable is a Marker interface
Shallow cloning: Object references refere to the same objects
Deep cloning: all objects that an object references are also clones

Exceptions  Brush up on this on my own over the weekend. **Explicitly said by Instructor** look at Day 8 document.

-------------------------------------Day 4-------------------------------
1.  ArithmeticException handling or any other runtime exception.
2.  Example of try, multiple catch, and finally block
3.  Impl 10 implement from reference take from implementation file.
4.  exception propagation using checked exception.
5.  Exception handling use cases in case of method overriding
6.  Create an Employee class with emp id, salary, name. have parameterized constructor.
    create two objects with the same employee details. And check whether it gives you true or false 
	then override equals method and basis of employee id return true or false.  Actually, we already did this.
6.  Immutable class example implementation


method overriding with checked vs unchecked exceptions

Immutable classes:    Only immutable classes can be 'final'
	*Are final classes
	*Have all private fields
	*Have no way to change those fields (no setter methods)
	*include an all-arguement constructor
	*use deep cloning for inheritly mutable object fields
	*returns only references to deep-cloned objects
	
sub-packages need to be imported seperately.
Kahled Mughal - Java book

int[] x = new int[5];  or = new int[] {1, 6, 0, 5, 8};   or  = {1, 6, 0, 5, 8};
List list = Arrays.asList(1, 6, 0, 5, 8);   
Arrays.sort(x);
Arrays.fill(x, 5);

   Try to do these on my own first
7.  find out the frequency of each element in array.    {1,3,5,6,7,4,1,3,5,3}  1:2,3:3,5:2,6:1...

---------------------------------Day 5------------------Multithreading-------------------------------

What is process and what is thread and their differences?

	Thread is the smallest part of a process. Example: autosave and spellcheck in MS Word. Shares memory with main process.

what is multithreading?

	Having multiple threads executing simultaiously.

What is the advantage of multithreading ?

	Better performance from the application. Example: multiple users using the same process.

How many ways we can create thread ?

	2. Implement Runnable, or extend the Thread class. 
	(Secret third way: pass an anonymous Runnable class.)

Which approach is better ?

	You must override the run() method in either case. Extending the Thread class, you might need to override other 
	constructors or methods. You also will not be able to extend another class at the same time.

Can we run same thread twice ?

	We can't start a thread multiple times. We will get java.lang.IllegalThreadStateException

t1.start();
			//we can't run same thread twice.
			t1.start();  //java.lang.IllegalThreadStateException
What is thread priority?

	Thread scheduler schedules the threads according to their priority.
	We have 3 priorities - max , norm , min 
	setPriority() method use to set priority for thread.
	1 to 10 represent priority.
	setPriority(10);,getPriority();
	By default every thread has normal priority.
	We have call set priority before calling start method.
	Main thread also have by default normal priority.
	
What is Thread Life Cycle ?

	When a Daddy thread and a Mommy thread love each other very much...

What is the use of Join method ?

	join() is used to put the current thread on hold until the specified thread finishes

What is the use of yield method ?
What is dead lock ?

	When a thread is holding a resource and also waiting on a resource which is being held by another thread.

What is thread scheduler in java ?

	The part of the virtual machine that controls when threads will get processor cycles vs. other threads.

What is the difference between start() and run() method call ?
Can we overload run method ?

	Yes, but only run() will be run by the thread scheduler.

What will happen if we don’t override the Thread class run() method?

	Nothing. Literally nothing will happen. Unless you just implemented Runnable and didn't override the method; then you will get an error.

Can  we override start method of thread class ?

	New threads will not be able to be created.

What happen when we call run method explicitly?

	It will run like a normal method.
	
 syncronized block    sysnchronized(the_object){ "your code" }
 the disadvantage of synchronization is that it reduces performance.
 
 Today's implementations:
1. Create thread using runnable interface.
2. Create thread using thread class.
3. Create thread using annonmous class. 
4. Implement join method.
5. Prepare 1 implentation of data inconsistancy.
6. Implement synchronization method 
7. Implement synchronization block
8. Implements wait, notify and notifyAll

FunctionalInterface cf = () -> { the code implementation }

interface can now have a default implementation of its methods. 

Utility class. methods that will be used widely in a project.
Predicate interface: looks like this:

public boolean test(T value);
}    Why would we use this?

Stream API : process data in a collections

intermediate operation: operation on data before another operation on that same data.
terminal operation: when you are converting your data into a different type.
streams and be generated from or to Sets or collections or arrays

Collection.stream().forEach(System.out::print());  
:: is method reference       Class::method  

stream.filter(Predicate)    a lambda expretion can be used directly in place of Predicate.  An example of intermediate operation
stream.map(Function)  use a lambda expression to perform operation on each element of the data
stream.sorted()   you may pass a Comparator or lambda function

---------------------Day 9----------------------------------------

Ques 1 - Given a sorted array of integers, return the low and high index of the given key.
         Return -1 if not found. The array length can be in millions with lots of duplicates. 
Ques 2 - Given an array of intervals as input where each interval has a start and end timestamps.
      Input array is sorted by starting timestamps.
      Merge overlapping intervals and return output array (list).
      Eg:
      Input: Intervals [(1, 5), (3, 7), (4, 6), (6, 8)]
      Output: [(1, 8)]		 
	  
	  For each interval in the input list,
		Step 1: check if the current element  value < the output interval y value. If it is, then it is overlapping
		Step 2: Update last interval of output list with merged interval i.e. the max value between y1 & y2
		Step 3: If it is not overlapping, add the current input interval element to the output list
	  
Ques 3 - Given an array, find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum.
      Input: -4, 2,-5,1,2,3,6,-5,1
      Output: the largest sum subarray starts at index 3 and ends at 6 and the largest sum is 12 
Ques 4 -  Given three integer arrays sorted in ascending order, find the smallest number that is common in all three arrays.
Ques 5 : Find second largest element in an array:
     Input: {2, 3, 10, 6, 4, 8, 1}
     Output: 8 
Ques 6: Given two sorted linked lists, merge them such that resulting linked list is also sorted.
     Input: List1: 4, 8, 15, 19        List2: 7, 9, 10, 16
     Output:  4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 19


Serial Stream vs Parallel Stream.   When to use parallel stream vs serial stream.

HashMap internal workings?
What is the difference between normal Collections and ConcurrentCollection?
What is the difference between fail-fast and fail-safe?
What is the difference between HashMap and ConcurrentHashMap?
What is the difference between HashMap and HashTable?
CopyOnWriteArrayList and CopyOnWriteArraySet?


HashMap internal workings: Array of intitially 16 "buckets" expanding automatically, each bucket contains a LinkedList of elements with 
	identical hashes, ie. "hash collision". The equals() method is used in the case of hash collision. After Java 8, after a threshold 
	is reached in a bucket, it is converted from a LinkedList to a BinaryTree to imporove search time.
ConcurrentCollection: Introduced around java 1.7. What is the difference between normal Collections and ConcurrentCollection? 
	Collections has a few classes that are not synchronized, the ones that are do not perform well. Uses fail-fast iterators that will throw 
	exceptions.  ConcurrentCollection is thread-safe, but also maintians performance. Implements fail-safe iterators that do not throw 
	exceptions, because they work on a temporary copy of the data.
What is the difference between HashMap and ConcurrentHashMap?  Intitial concurrancy level is 16 by default, because each bucket is locked 
	individually. It does not lock anything for reading operations. Collections contains a method for generating a synchronized version
	of your List, Set, Vector, Map, or HashMap. HashMap is not synchronized by default. ConcurrentHashMap does not allow a null object.
	Null usually gets put at the 0th element.
What is the difference between HashMap and HashTable? HashTable has every method synchronized, HashMap has no method synchronized. 
	HashMap allows a null, HashTable does not and will throw a NullPointerException. HashMap was built after HashTable as an improvement
	on performance.
CopyOnWriteArrayList and CopyOnWriteArraySet? They are thread safe. When a writing method is called it creates an internal copy of the List
	that accepts the changes and will eventually synchronize the changes to the original List. It doesn't use locking for reading?

	Spring is loosely coupled. you will never need to extend spring classes into your work.
	
	A problem occurs when a signature or name of a class changes, if it was used somewhere else.
	When the type of the object is specified, after the new keyword, and where the method is called.

-----------------------------------Day 12-------------------------------------------

String handling:

Anything in "" is created and stored in a string constant pool
 String.intern() accesses reference to string literal.
Strings that are the same value are actually different references to the same String objects in the pool.
Strings are immutable for security reasons. Also, it creates a new object instead of changing the object to
avoid changing other references to the same String. Also this makes them thread safe.

StringBuffer is not immutable. It will make changes to the same container. Mutable, instead of immutable.
StringBuffer does not override the equals() method. It is also synchronized.
Also StringBuilder. StringBuilder is not thread-safe.
Passwords should be stored in a char array, because if stored as a string, the old password would be still
be in the pool. 
concat() method only accepts strings as arguments. String.valueOf() accepts any type as an arguement.
Integer.parseInt() will go the other way.

	and metadata. Responsible for managing lifecycle of beans and those objects.
	BeanFactory or ApplicationContect (supports annotations) or others
	ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext();
	
Bean = Spring definition of a particular java object.

Primative injection: using Constuctors or setter methods for primative value setting.
Dependence injection: injecting another bean object as an object value. 2 types of 
	dependence injection: setter injection and constructor injection.

Collection Injection: 
	<property name="stores">
		<list value-type="java.lang.String">
			<value>Aushan</value>
			<value>Walmart</value>
		</list>
